## Installing this collection

You can install the Commscope ICX collection with the Ansible Galaxy CLI:

    ansible-galaxy collection install dark_land.icx

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it with `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```
## Using this collection


This collection includes [network resource modules](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/network/user_guide/network_resource_modules.html).

### Using modules from the Commscope ICX collection in your playbooks

You can call modules by their Fully Qualified Collection Namespace (FQCN), such as `dark_land.icx.icx_vlan`.
The following example task replaces configuration changes in the existing configuration on a RUCKUS ICX switch, using the FQCN:

```yaml
---
  - name: Add a single ethernet 1/1/48 as access(untagged) port to vlan 20
    dark_land.icx.icx_vlan:
      name: test-vlan
      vlan_id: 20
      interfaces:
        name:
          - ethernet 1/1/48

```

**NOTE**: For Ansible 2.9, you may not see deprecation warnings when you run your playbooks with this collection. Use this documentation to track when a module is deprecated.
